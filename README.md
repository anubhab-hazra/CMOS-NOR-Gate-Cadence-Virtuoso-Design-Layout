# CMOS NOR Gate — Cadence Virtuoso Design & Layout

Transistor-level CMOS NOR gate designed and verified in **Cadence Virtuoso**. Includes schematic, generated symbol, layout, testbench, DRC/LVS verification, and functional validation through transient simulation.

---

## 📌 Short description
Two-input CMOS NOR gate implemented at transistor level. Verified using schematic simulation and layout parasitic checks with DRC and LVS clean results.

---

## 📝 Key results
- **Schematic NOR gate simulation:** Logic function validated (output HIGH only when both inputs are LOW).  
- **Generated symbol** for hierarchical reuse.  
- **Layout (Layout XL):** Designed, routed, and verified.  
- **DRC:** Clean (no violations).  
- **LVS:** Clean, matches schematic.

## 🛠 Tools & environment
- **Cadence Virtuoso** (schematic, symbol, layout design)  
- **Layout XL** (for DRC / LVS checks)  
- **ADE / Spectre** (for functional simulation and transient waveforms)
